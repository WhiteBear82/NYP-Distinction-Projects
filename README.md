## Description of my projects:

**Year 2 (Semester 1) - Network Security & Project**
For this project, I developed a web application, which includes a platform for users to add friends and socialize, a personal calendar for each user to add and view their events, an email sending platform that they can login using their Google, Yahoo or Hotmail/Outlook Account, and an achievement page as an incentives for attracting and maintaining users.
In addition, I also applied Network Security concepts to the web application, such as Network Load Balancing, Availability and Redundancy, as well as Secured Email Service.
The web application and database was hosted in the Cloud.

**Year 2 (Semester 2) - Applications Security & Project**
For this project, I developed a web application, which includes a platform for users to pre-order food or to set up stalls to sell their food :)
Security aspects of this project were mostly focused. Such security measures that I implemented include a Re-Captcha register/login mechanism, input validation (both client- and server-side) on all input fields, database security, as well as an audit log to view web app activity, including errors and potential attacks.

**Year 3 - Operations Security & Project**
For this project, I was in charge of _Change and Configuration Management_.
_Ansible_ is the software I used for Configuration Management. For Change Management, I developed a _C# WPF_ application from scratch, that allows an effective and communicated change management process throughout the organization. This application follows the ISO/IEC 38500:2008, Corporate Governance of IT as well as the ISO/IEC 31000:2018, Risk Management International Standards.
After which, I connected my _C# WPF_ application with _Ansible_ (ensuring interoperability), which eventually forms a powerful tool for _Change and Configuration Management_, which makes the Change and Configuration process effective, communicated, non-technical, and simultaneous.
This was the project that allowed me to learn the most and was most satisfied with.
